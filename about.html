        My name is Nathan and I am currently an electronic engineering student at ENSEEIHT. I'm Brazilian, I was born in Salvador, Bahia, but I grew up in a city called Natal, Rio Grande do Norte. In Brazil, I was studying electrical engineering and through an exchange programme I was able to join ENSEEIHT.My first contact with engineering was during the technical course in buildings where I had a lot of contact with disciplines related to civil engineering. But it was during the discipline of electrical installations that I discovered that my passion was in electrical engineering. I've worked as monitor of the electrical installations laboratory and it's always gratifying to help and teach people as well i learn with students because everyone asks different questions. I've also worked as an intern at a big telecom company called CaboTelecom where I learned a lot about FTTH (Fiber to the home) and HFC (hybrid Fiber Coaxial) technologies.
